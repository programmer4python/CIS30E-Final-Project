# CIS30E-Final-Project
Advanced Python Programming Final Project

Hello there!
Welcome to my final project.  The python programming project encompasses a port scan, a low-level DoS attack and in turn a look at the how the computer resources such as cpu and ram utilization are affected.

New concepts implemented in this final project from the current semester include asynchronous programming, multithreading, multiprocessing, cProfile from the cli, and design patterns. 

New concepts learned as a result of the project outside of class include live plotting, applying a secondary y axis, and combining the mvc design pattern with Tkinter.  How to access computer resource metrics using python was also learned.  

Enjoy!
